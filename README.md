## RepoToText

**RepoToText** is a versatile web application designed to convert the contents of a GitHub repository into a single, well-organized text file. Enter the URL of any GitHub repository along with an optional documentation URL to compile all files and directories into one text file, including any specified documentation. This file is ideal for interaction with language models like GPT-4, Claude Opus, and others. The resulting .txt file is saved in the `/data` folder, timestamped and organized for easy access.
