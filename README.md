GitToText is a tool designed to fetch all files from a GitHub repository and convert them into a text format for easy reading and documentation purposes.

## Overview

This repository contains the initial version of GitToText. The project was later split into two separate repositories to better manage the frontend and backend components.

- [GitToText-Frontend](https://github.com/bfuerholz/GitToText-Frontend): Contains the React-based frontend application.
- [GitToText-Backend](https://github.com/bfuerholz/GitToText-Backend): Contains the Flask-based backend application.

## Why Split the Repositories?

The separation was necessary to:
- Improve modularity and maintainability of the codebase.
- Allow independent development and deployment of the frontend and backend.
- Enable better scalability and management of each component.

For more detailed information, please refer to the specific repositories linked above.
